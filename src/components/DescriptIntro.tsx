        I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Alberta, graduating in Spring 2025. 
        I’m passionate about building systems that connect hardware and software, especially with tech that makes a 
        real-world impact. Outside of engineering, I’m into personal finance, playing guitar, training MMA, and hitting
         the golf course when I can. Whether I’m debugging code or working on my swing, I love tackling challenges and 
         constantly learning.
